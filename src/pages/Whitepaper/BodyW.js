                        Our first NFT collection consist of 2,000 NFTs including creature, effect, counter, & wild cards. 
                        The cards will be used in a web3 P2E trading card game. 
                        Our mission is to build the Duel Realms brand through physical cards, digital items, & gaming!

                        Cards will consist of unique monsters, effects, counters, and “wilds” depicted by their own special art image overlaid onto the Duel Realms Card format. 
                        The Duel Realms cards format includes edition (if applicable), name, card number, power points, description, and level. 
                        These cards will be NFT’s existing on the Ethereum blockchain, mintable through the official Duel Realms website during collection drops. 
                        Physical copies of these cards will also be produced and released in very special offerings, allowing those lucky users to play the game in real life.

                        The game will be free for everyone to play & earn. We believe that the best way to build a successful game is to give everyone access to it. 
                            NFT holders will get multiple benefits that non holders will not.
                        We will have default decks for people to choose from when playing! Gamers will be able to play against each other or against an AI.
                        In the future once we release more collections, people with 15 cards or more will be able to use their custom deck to play the game. <br></br>
