                        Duel Realms is a NFT (non-fungible token) project composed of various pixelated “cards” integrated within a P2W (play-to-win) trading card game. 
                        The mission of Duel Realms is to become the front-running NFT project that bridges the gap between Web3 and the TCG (trading card game) sector. 
                        By a combination of mutually beneficial partnerships with other prominent NFT projects, unique offerings to Duel Realms community members, and an ever-evolving trading card game with a low barrier to entry — 
                        Duel Realms is constructed to make an everlasting impact on the NFT space.

                        <h1  id="text2">What are the Cards?</h1><br></br>
                        Cards will consist of unique monsters, effects, counters, and “wilds” depicted by their own special art image overlaid onto the Duel Realms Card format. 
                        The Duel Realms cards format includes edition (if applicable), name, card number, power points, description, and level. 
                        These cards will be NFT’s existing on the Ethereum blockchain, mintable through the official Duel Realms website during collection drops. 
                        Physical copies of these cards will also be produced and released in very special offerings, allowing those lucky users to play the game in real life.

                        <h1 id="text3">Collector Card Collection</h1><br></br>
                        Collector card collections will be comprised of 2,000 NFTs at a mint price of 0.075 eth with royalties set at 4%. This kind of collection drop will include different editions of cards: OG, Alpha, and Diamond. 
                        These editions translate to rarity and are indicated by the coloring of the card format, with Diamond being the rarest, and OG being the most common for this collection — hence the name “Collector” Card Collection.<br></br><br></br>
                        Other benefits of minting from the Collector Card Collection include: earning $DUEL token without staking, ability to play in Duel Realms Tournaments, and whitelist for subsequent Collector Card Collections.
                        <br></br><br></br>
                            Those who mint an NFT from the Collector Card Collection will receive a free physical starter deck. 
                            The starter deck will consist of 1 copy of every card from the collection (all monsters, effects, counters, and “wilds”). 
                            The cards will be front-holographic and shipped within a custom Duel Realms starter deck box.

                        Deck Builder Collections will be comprised of 15,000 NFTs. 
                        These cards can be purchased using $DUEL token and accepted partnership tokens. 
                        This kind of collection drop will not include different editions. 
                        The main purpose of this collection is to allow more people to be able to play the digital game, and enable members to build out their decks to fit their own strategies — all at a very low cost.

                        Partnership Card Collections are dropped when Duel Realms establishes a long-standing partnership with another NFT project. 
                        The two projects work in conjunction to create a card of the partnered project’s character, with only 100 of these NFT’s available for purchase via $DUEL token. 
                        There will be a 2% royalty set for all partnership collections.

                        The Duel Realms Marketplace provides rewards for those who hold Collector cards. 
                        Offerings that will be claimable through $DUEL token, partnership tokens, crypto, and USD include whitelist spots for other projects, various Duel Realms NFT cards, physical foil packs, physical holographic cards, merchandise, etc.

                        <h1 id="text7">Tokenomics</h1><br></br>
                        The $DUEL token will be an ERC-20 token on the Polygon Network. 
                        This will be accrued passively by holding any Collector Card NFTs or by winning rewards via Duel Realms Tournaments. 
                        1 $DUEL token = 1 $DUEL token. 
                        You can use these tokens to claim Deck Builder Collection cards and other rewards directly from the DRM.
